### 🔎 **SQL Tasks & Analysis:**

Some key queries include:

1. Count by Obesity Category
2. Average Weight by Gender
3. Obesity vs Physical Activity
4. Smoking Impact
5. Transportation Mode vs Obesity
6. Obesity Level by Age Group
7. Water Intake vs Obesity
8. BMI Calculation using height and weight
